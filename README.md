# UTC - Universal Temperature Controller

This is a work-in-progress repository for creating a temperature controller that can be used in many situations like BBQ smokers and sous vide.

This is the next generation controller based on my previous [UDS] (http://www.instructables.com/id/Tweeting-Wireless-Ugly-Drum-Smoker-UDS-tempera/)
