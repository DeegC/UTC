Installed Bluez and blueman, paired phone.  Turn on BT tethering on phone.  Was able to use
blueman-applet to get PAN working.

In applet: List devices then select "View/Local Services...".  Under PAN Support select "Blueman (dhclient)"

Once PAN was working was able to follow instructions in this post to set up cron job to connect:

(I installed bt-pan but don't remember how.)
